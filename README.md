This repository contains the final project for the Fundamentals of Programming discipline in PUCRS, developed during the 2023/1 semester by Heloysa Pelizon and Marina Bon in the program of Computer Science.

The project was proposed as a foundation for learning object-oriented programming in Java and consolidation of basic concepts of the language and programming in general - such as vectors, matrices, as well as the usage of method manager classes and hierarchy in Java.

The work made serves as a backend system for a basic medical software that handles patient information for up to 10 patients. It served as foundation for good programming practices once it was a project that encompassed all the basic concepts learned along the discipline.

The code is made entirely in Java and does not require any libraries. It has its output on the terminal of the development environment chosen.
